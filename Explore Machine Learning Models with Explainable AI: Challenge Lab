# Task 1


Navigation Menu > Storage > Cloud Storage > Create Bucket.

Navigation Menu > ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE > AI Platform > Notebooks > Create Notebook.
/* Use configs as given in the challenge. */


# Task 2


/* Open Jupyter Notebook which you created in the last task. */
> Terminal.

/* Run the following commad. */

git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/training-data-analyst

In notebook navigate to: training-data-analyst/quests/dei and open what-if-tool-challenge.ipynb.

Running first 2 cells will complete the task.


# Task 3


/* Paste the following code into the 10th cell and start running the cell. Make sure you've executed all previous cells.

model = Sequential()
model.add(layers.Dense(8, input_dim=input_size))
model.add(layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))
model.compile(optimizer='sgd', loss='mse')
model.fit(train_data, train_labels, batch_size=32, epochs=10)

*/

/* Paste the following code into the 13th cell and start running the cell.

limited_model = Sequential()
limited_model.add(layers.Dense(8, input_dim=input_size))
limited_model.add(layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))
limited_model.compile(optimizer='sgd', loss='mse')
limited_model.fit(limited_train_data, limited_train_labels, batch_size=32, epochs=10)

*/


# Task 4


Fill in the GCP_PROJECT and MODEL_BUCKET in cell 16 and start executing remaining cells.

/* Back in GCP. */
Navigation Menu > ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE > AI Platform > Models.
> Create Model.
/* Use model name as given in the challenge. */
/* Click on the model created. */
> Create version.
/* Use configs as given in the challenge. */

Repeat same for the second model.

/* This can also be done by creating further cells in the notebook. For code refer to the previous labs in the same quest. */
